# IMT_542_I3

IMT 542 - Tara Hulcome

## Overview

For this IMT 542 task (I3), I will walk through the process of integrating and visualizing scores from the 2025 NCAA Women's College Gymnastics Championships, held on 17-19 April 2025 in Dallas-Fort Worth TX. This project is useful as it allows the user to synthesize and interrogate data from 320 individual events across 3 separate competitions (including semi-final and final rounds). The user will be able to combine and transform the three datasets, comparing scores achieved by the 8 final teams and their individual athletes.

## Instructions

**Step 1.**

Find updated links to the 2025 NCAA Women's College Gymnastics Championships, via Balance Beam Situation website: https://balancebeamsituation.com/2025/04/16/2025-nationals-schedule-links/

**Step 2.**

Follow links to Virtius scoring platform for each of the three competition rounds:

•	Semifinal I competition scores: https://virti.us/session?s=xhZmjBrMse 

•	Semifinal II competition scores: https://virti.us/session?s=3mxRqdyuqJ 

•	National Championship scores: https://virti.us/session?s=jbwIq0qS0k 

**Step 3.**

As Virtius' Terms of Service do not permit web crawling / scraping activities, manually save full competition data from the ‘stats’ tab. Convert to CSV format and save locally. 

**Step 4**

Copy the three CSV files to Google CoLab and begin coding, using the Gemini AI assistant if required (as per code examples shown in linked file below). The specific task is to experiment with creating scatter plot graphs that show the range of scores achieved across all four events (where FX = floor, UB = uneven bars, BB = balance beam, VT = vault), and comparing scores of the two strongest gymnastics teams (UCLA and Oklahoma).

## Other ways to use this data

While it is possible to create data visualizations in Google CoLab (as demonstrated above), there are other data visualization tools that are quicker and easier to use for manipulating data. The example below (see link) shows how Tableau can be used to integrate and synthesize the data to tell a compelling and interesting story.
